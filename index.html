			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>
				<em>Note: If you’re not me, you’re unlikely to have much use for this Forms Collator.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				The Forms Collator works on data for my Latin rhyming dictionary, <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/">velut</a>.
				It converts a list of words with their lemmata to a Json object of lemmata with the words that are their words. It’s very simple, but it does what I want.
			</p>

			<p>
				This webpage is nice for showing you what the collator does.
				You can input several words (and the lemma or lemmata for each) in the first box, click “Generate Json”, and see the output in the second box.
				The resultant Json can be downloaded or copied to the clipboard.
			</p>

			<p>
				But the collator can also be used by simply running <a href="https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut-forms-collator/blob/main/generator.js">one JavaScript file named collator.js</a> in Node, outside of the browser.
				If it’s running in Node, it reads from a hardcoded filepath and saves its output to two other hardcoded filepaths.
				(One of the output files is pretty-printed, the other isn’t.)
				Once the output is on my hard drive, my idea is that other scripts can read from it.
			</p>

			<h3>Input and output format</h3>

			<p>
				Each line of input must be a word, whitespace, and the space-separated list of lemmata.
				The “Load sample” button will give you some examples; the examples use a tab for the whitespace between the word and the lemmata, because you get tabs when pasting from Excel cells.
				But you can use a normal space (or several) if you prefer.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Json generated is an object where each lemma is a key and the value is the array of words.
			</p>

			<h3>Testing in the browser</h3>

			<p>
				If you’re not me, you won’t have access to all the input data, nor will you have access to the data from Excel that I compare the output to in Node.
				But you can <a href="#testing">run tests</a> yourself in your browser’s console by clicking the “Run tests” button above.
				There aren’t many tests and they aren’t very sophisticated, but they demonstrate that my code works as I expect.
			</p>

			<h3>The velut Excel file</h3>

			<p>
				Although the velut website uses a MongoDB database, and this page produces Json data that could go into a MongoDB database, I privately have a large Excel file for generating and storing the data in velut.
				In one of the sheets of the Excel file, the words are in one column and their lemmata are in the next column — hence the format of the input in the Forms Collator.
			</p>

			<h3>Some problems with velut</h3>

			<p>
				I’m currently storing a list of lemmata for each word.
				But there’s no grammatical parsing information at the word level.
				So velut knows that <i lang="la">amās</i> is a form of the lemma <i lang="la">amō</i>, and velut knows that <i lang="la">amō</i> is a verb that means “love”, but there’s nothing saying <i lang="la">amās</i> is second-person singular present active indicative.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are also several words missing from velut.
				I believe I have all the forms of <i lang="la">amō</i> (excluding encliticized forms such as <i lang="la">amōque</i>) in velut.
				However, for most verbs I have omitted most forms, and I am also missing forms of most nouns/adjectives/adverbs.
			</p>

			<h3>Improving on the Excel file</h3>

			<p>
				Omitting the parsing information made building velut easier.
				Skipping forms allowed me to concentrate more on other parts of the dictionary.
				But I now want to make sure I have all the forms of all the lemmata in velut, with the parsing data too.
			</p>

			<p>
				My plan is to write a script that generates all the forms for every lemma programmatically.
				To this end, it would be useful to see what forms I currently have for each lemma, and to compare whatever my new script would produce with what I currently have.
				So this Forms Collator will be a small but crucial part of that.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is all part of my long-term project of converting my Excel file into websites and webpages that are easier to share and maintain.
				I’m very much in a transition period of using the Excel file for some things and my newer websites/webpages for others.
				But the Forms Collator is another step in the process.
				At the moment, the whole velut project is very convoluted; in the future, it won’t be as bad.
